- **Prometheus: Fundamentals of Monitoring**
	- **Definition**:
		- **Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, originally developed at SoundCloud.
		- It provides a multi-dimensional data model, real-time metrics collection, flexible querying, and alerting.
		- Commonly used in environments with **microservices**, [[Kubernetes]] clusters, and #Docker-based workloads.
	- **Why Prometheus?**
		- **Time-Series Database (TSDB)**:
			- Prometheus stores all metrics as time-series data, identified by metric names and key-value pairs (labels).
			- This structure facilitates detailed and flexible querying of metrics over time.
		- **Pull-Based Model**:
			- Prometheus scrapes (pulls) metrics from targets (e.g., application endpoints, exporters).
			- Simplifies architecture in dynamic environments like [[Kubernetes]], where endpoints may frequently change.
		- **Highly Scalable**:
			- Designed for cloud-native scaling.
			- Can handle large volumes of metrics, especially when sharded or federated across multiple Prometheus servers.
		- **Powerful Query Language (PromQL)**:
			- PromQL lets you filter, aggregate, and evaluate time-series data in real-time.
			- Enables advanced dashboarding and alerting scenarios.
	- **Core Components**:
		- 1. **Prometheus Server**:
			- Scrapes metrics from configured targets.
			- Stores data locally in a time-series database.
			- Executes alerts based on PromQL expressions.
		- 2. **Exporters**:
			- Collect and expose metrics for various systems (e.g., **Node Exporter** for Linux, CPU/memory stats).
			- Allows monitoring of databases, caches, or even custom applications.
		- 3. **Alertmanager**:
			- Handles alerts generated by the Prometheus server.
			- Routes alerts to different channels (e.g., #Slack, Email, PagerDuty).
			- Supports grouping, silencing, and inhibition rules.
		- 4. **PromQL**:
			- Query language used to select and aggregate time-series data.
			- Example: `sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))` aggregates HTTP requests over the last 5 minutes.
		- 5. **Service Discovery**:
			- Integrates with platforms like [[Kubernetes]], [[Docker]] Swarm, [[AWS]], or static configurations.
			- Dynamically updates scrape targets as services come and go.
	- **Metrics Collection Flow**:
		- 1. **Application/Exporter**:
			- An application or exporter exposes metrics via HTTP endpoint (e.g., `:9100/metrics`).
		- 2. **Prometheus Server**:
			- Scrapes these metrics at configured intervals.
		- 3. **Local TSDB**:
			- Metrics are stored in Prometheus’s local time-series database.
		- 4. **PromQL**:
			- Users query stored metrics for dashboards, troubleshooting, or capacity planning.
		- 5. **Alertmanager**:
			- If queries match alerting rules, alerts are routed to on-call systems or #Slack.
	- **Deployment & Integration**:
		- **Stand-Alone Deployment**:
			- Install binaries in a VM or bare-metal environment.
			- Configure `prometheus.yml` for scrape targets.
			- Good for smaller on-prem or single-cloud use cases.
		- **Containerized**:
			- Run in #Docker or #Podman, specifying `prometheus.yml` via a volume.
			- Easy to incorporate into [[Kubernetes]] using Helm charts or operator-based deployment.
		- **High Availability**:
			- Run multiple Prometheus servers with identical scrape configs for redundancy.
			- Use external storage or remote-write solutions for long-term data retention.
		- **Integration with #Grafana**:
			- Grafana is a popular dashboarding tool that can query Prometheus and visualize data in real-time.
			- Typically used together for advanced data visualization.
	- **Use Cases**:
		- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network for servers and VMs.
		- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Request latencies, error rates, concurrency levels.
		- **Microservices**:
			- Each service can expose custom metrics to track performance or business-related KPIs.
		- **[[Kubernetes]]**:
			- Monitor cluster health (nodes, pods, deployments, etc.) using the **kube-state-metrics** and **cAdvisor** exporters.
		- **Alerting**:
			- Automate notifications for critical conditions (e.g., high CPU usage, error spikes).
			- Integrate with #Slack, Email, or PagerDuty to handle on-call escalations.
	- **Basic Configuration Example** (simplified `prometheus.yml`):
	  ```yaml
	  global:
	    scrape_interval: 15s
	    evaluation_interval: 15s
	  
	  scrape_configs:
	    - job_name: 'node_exporter'
	      static_configs:
	        - targets: ['192.168.1.10:9100']
	    - job_name: 'my_app'
	      static_configs:
	        - targets: ['192.168.1.20:8080']
	  ```
		- **`scrape_interval`**: Frequency of scraping targets.
		- **`evaluation_interval`**: Frequency of evaluating alert rules.
		- **`scrape_configs`**: Lists each scrape target (job).
	- **Tips & Best Practices**:
		- **Use Labels Wisely**: Metrics are key-value pairs—avoid label bloat that can cause performance issues.
		- **Alert Tuning**: Set realistic thresholds to avoid alert fatigue. Group or route alerts meaningfully in Alertmanager.
		- **Record Rules**: Precompute frequently queried metrics to reduce PromQL load at query time.
		- **Retention & Storage**:
			- By default, Prometheus stores data locally, which might not be suitable for long-term retention.
			- Consider a remote storage adapter or solutions like Thanos, Cortex, or Mimir for extended historical data.
		- **Security**:
			- Enable TLS or a reverse proxy for the Prometheus and exporters endpoints if publicly exposed.
			- Restrict write/administrative access carefully to prevent malicious metric injection.
	- **Conclusion**:
		- **Prometheus** is a cornerstone for modern observability, especially in containerized or microservice environments like [[Kubernetes]].
		- The pull-based metrics collection, combined with PromQL and integrated alerting, provides a flexible monitoring solution.
		- By pairing Prometheus with tools like #Grafana for visualization and best practices around labeling and alert management, you can build a robust, scalable monitoring ecosystem.
- **Installing Prometheus on a Linux Server**
	- **Overview**:
		- **Prometheus** is distributed as precompiled binaries for various operating systems, including Linux.
		- A typical setup involves creating a dedicated Prometheus user, placing configuration files in standard locations, and running Prometheus as a service (e.g., via `systemd`).
		  
		  ---
	- **1. Download and Extract**
		- **Definition**:
			- Prometheus provides official binaries. You can download them from the [Prometheus releases page](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases) or use package managers if available.
		- **Example Steps** (using wget and tar):
		  ```bash
		  # 1. Fetch the latest release (example version: 2.41.0)
		  wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.41.0/prometheus-2.41.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
		  
		  # 2. Extract the tarball
		  tar xvf prometheus-2.41.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
		  
		  # 3. Move binaries to /usr/local/bin
		  cd prometheus-2.41.0.linux-amd64
		  sudo mv prometheus /usr/local/bin/
		  sudo mv promtool /usr/local/bin/
		  
		  # 4. Move console libraries and templates (optional if you want default console pages)
		  sudo mkdir -p /etc/prometheus
		  sudo mv consoles /etc/prometheus/
		  sudo mv console_libraries /etc/prometheus/
		  ```
			- Adjust version numbers and paths to your environment.
			  
			  ---
	- **2. User and Directories**
		- **Definition**:
			- Create a dedicated user/group for running Prometheus to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
		- **Example**:
		  ```bash
		  # Create a prometheus user (no shell, no home directory)
		  sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin prometheus
		  
		  # Create directories for configuration and data
		  sudo mkdir -p /etc/prometheus
		  sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/prometheus
		  
		  # Set ownership
		  sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
		  sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
		  ```
		  
		  ---
	- **3. Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)**
		- **Definition**:
			- The main configuration file defines global settings, scrape intervals, and scrape targets.
		- **Basic Example**:
		  ```yaml
		  global:
		    scrape_interval: 15s
		    evaluation_interval: 15s
		  
		  scrape_configs:
		  - job_name: "node_exporter"
		    static_configs:
		    - targets: ["localhost:9100"]
		  ```
			- Place this file in `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.
			- **Key Directives**:
				- `scrape_interval`: How often Prometheus scrapes each target.
				- `scrape_configs`: Specifies endpoints (targets) to scrape.
		- **Set Ownership**:
		  ```bash
		  sudo mv prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
		  sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
		  ```
		  
		  ---
	- **4. Running Prometheus as a Service (systemd)**
		- **Definition**:
			- Using a systemd service file ensures Prometheus starts on boot and can be managed via `systemctl`.
		- **Example service file** (`/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service`):
		  ```ini
		  [Unit]
		  Description=Prometheus Monitoring
		  Wants=network-online.target
		  After=network-online.target
		  
		  [Service]
		  User=prometheus
		  Group=prometheus
		  Type=simple
		  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
		    --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
		    --storage.tsdb.path=/var/lib/prometheus/ \
		    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
		    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
		  Restart=on-failure
		  
		  [Install]
		  WantedBy=multi-user.target
		  ```
			- **Key Flags**:
				- `--config.file`: Path to your `prometheus.yml`.
				- `--storage.tsdb.path`: Directory where metrics data is stored.
				- `--web.console.*`: Paths to optional web console templates/libraries.
		- **Reload and Start**:
		  ```bash
		  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
		  sudo systemctl enable prometheus
		  sudo systemctl start prometheus
		  
		  # Check status
		  systemctl status prometheus
		  ```
		- **Verify**:
			- By default, Prometheus listens on port `9090`.
			- You can access the web UI at:  
			  ```plaintext
			  http://<server-ip>:9090
			  ```
			  
			  ---
	- **5. Validating Installation**
		- **Local Host Check**:
			- `curl http://localhost:9090/metrics` to see raw metrics.
			- `curl http://localhost:9090/-/healthy` for a quick health check.
		- **Web UI**:
			- Access the Prometheus expression browser at `<server-ip>:9090/graph`.
			- Explore default metrics like `up` to confirm the scrape is working.
			  
			  ---
	- **6. Basic Security Considerations**
		- **Access Control**:
			- Out of the box, Prometheus has no authentication/authorization.
			- Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or OAuth proxy if you need authentication.
		- **Firewall**:
			- Restrict access to port `9090` to trusted networks/IP addresses.
		- **TLS Encryption**:
			- Prometheus can run behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS if you require HTTPS.
			  
			  ---
	- **7. Next Steps**:
		- **Add Exporters**:
			- For node metrics, install **Node Exporter** on the same or other servers (listening on port `9100` by default).
			- Update `prometheus.yml` to scrape those endpoints.
		- **Set Up Alertmanager**:
			- Configure alerting rules in `prometheus.yml`.
			- Install and configure Alertmanager to handle alert routing.
		- **Dashboarding**:
			- Install #Grafana and connect it to Prometheus for a richer visualization experience.
		- **Scale / HA**:
			- Consider using multiple Prometheus instances for high availability or explore long-term storage solutions (Thanos, Cortex, etc.).
