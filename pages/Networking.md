- **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)**
	- **Overview**:
		- The OSI Model is a seven-layer reference model developed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) to standardize network communication processes.
		- Each layer performs specific tasks and interacts with the layers above and below, providing a complete pathway for data transmission from sender to receiver.
	- **Layer 1: Physical Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Defines the physical characteristics for data transmission: electrical signals, voltages, frequencies, connectors, and cables.
			- Responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating physical connections between devices.
		- **Protocols and Technologies**:
			- Ethernet (physical part), USB, Bluetooth, DSL, ISDN.
		- **Devices**:
			- Hubs, repeaters, cables, connectors, modems.
		- **Example**: Transmission of bits over copper wire or fiber optic cable.
	- **Layer 2: Data Link Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Manages data transfer between neighboring network nodes.
			- Controls access to the transmission medium using MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
			- Provides framing, error detection, and correction.
		- **Sub-layers**:
			- **MAC (Media Access Control)**: Manages access to the physical transmission medium.
			- **LLC (Logical Link Control)**: Handles link establishment and error handling.
		- **Protocols and Technologies**:
			- Ethernet (data link part), PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control).
		- **Devices**:
			- Switches, Network Interface Cards (NIC).
	- **Layer 3: Network Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Determines packet routing between different networks.
			- Provides logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses).
			- Handles packet fragmentation and reassembly.
		- **Protocols**:
			- IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), RIP (Routing Information Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
		- **Devices**:
			- Routers.
		- **Example**: Determining the optimal path for data transmission from sender to receiver.
	- **Layer 4: Transport Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Ensures reliable data transmission between nodes, segmenting and reassembling data.
			- Provides flow control and error handling.
			- Establishes virtual connections between nodes.
		- **Protocols**:
			- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) — reliable, connection-oriented transmission.
			- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) — faster, connectionless transmission.
		- **Mechanisms**:
			- **Ports**: Identifiers for distinguishing applications (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
	- **Layer 5: Session Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Manages the establishment, maintenance, and termination of communication sessions between applications.
			- Synchronizes communication and manages data exchange.
		- **Use Cases**:
			- Remote access sessions, video and audio conferencing, and streaming.
		- **Protocols**:
			- NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call), PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol).
	- **Layer 6: Presentation Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Handles data translation, encryption, compression, and format conversion.
			- Converts data between transmission format and application-specific format.
		- **Examples**:
			- Data encryption (SSL/TLS), text encoding (ASCII, EBCDIC), image compression (JPEG, PNG).
	- **Layer 7: Application Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Provides an interface for applications to interact with the network.
			- Offers access to network services and functions, directly interacting with users.
		- **Protocols**:
			- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
		- **Use Cases**:
			- Web browsers, email clients, remote access systems.
	- **Additional Facts**:
		- **Layer Interaction**: Each layer in the OSI model interacts only with its adjacent layers, ensuring modularity and flexibility in network communications.
		- **Real-World Analogy**: The OSI model can be compared to sending a letter through the postal system, where each layer performs a specific function (writing, packaging, addressing, delivering, etc.).
	- **Benefits of the OSI Model**:
		- **Standardization**: Provides a standardized approach to network communication.
		- **Interoperability**: Simplifies interaction between different manufacturers and technologies.
		- **Modularity**: Allows changes at one layer without impacting the entire system.
