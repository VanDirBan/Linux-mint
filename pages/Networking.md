	- **Layer 7: Application Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Provides an interface for applications to interact with the network.
			- Offers access to network services and functions, directly interacting with users.
		- **Protocols**:
			- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
		- **Use Cases**:
			- Web browsers, email clients, remote access systems.
	- **Additional Facts**:
		- **Layer Interaction**: Each layer in the OSI model interacts only with its adjacent layers, ensuring modularity and flexibility in network communications.
		- **Real-World Analogy**: The OSI model can be compared to sending a letter through the postal system, where each layer performs a specific function (writing, packaging, addressing, delivering, etc.).
	- **Benefits of the OSI Model**:
		- **Standardization**: Provides a standardized approach to network communication.
		- **Interoperability**: Simplifies interaction between different manufacturers and technologies.
		- **Modularity**: Allows changes at one layer without impacting the entire system.
- **TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**
	- **Overview**:
		- The TCP/IP Model is a concise, practical framework for network communication used in most modern networks, including the internet.
		- It consists of four layers that define how data is transmitted across interconnected devices and networks.
		- Unlike the OSI model's 7 layers, the TCP/IP model focuses more on protocols and real-world implementations.
	- **Layer 1: Network Interface (Link) Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Responsible for handling the physical transmission of data between devices within the same network.
			- Manages protocols for accessing the physical network, including addressing and framing.
			- This layer combines the functionality of the Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model.

			- Responsible for logical addressing, routing, and packet forwarding between networks.
			- Provides mechanisms for data encapsulation, fragmentation, and reassembly.
			- Corresponds to the Network layer in the OSI model.

			- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) — Used for error messages and operational queries (e.g., `ping` command).
			- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) — Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.

		- **Example**: Determining the best route to send packets from one device to another over the internet using IP addresses.
	- **Layer 3: Transport Layer**
		- **Functions**:
			- Provides end-to-end communication, error checking, and data flow control between devices.
			- Manages the segmentation, transfer, and reassembly of data packets.

		- **Protocols**:
			- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
				- Reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures data is delivered in the correct order and without errors.

	- **Additional Notes**:
