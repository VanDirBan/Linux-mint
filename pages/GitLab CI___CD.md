- **GitLab CI/CD: Basics of Creating a Pipeline**
	- **Overview**:
		- GitLab CI/CD is an integrated continuous integration and continuous deployment tool built into GitLab.
		- It automates the build, test, and deployment processes for your projects by defining pipelines in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
		- Pipelines consist of jobs organized into stages, running sequentially or in parallel based on defined dependencies.
		  
		  ---
	- **1. Core Concepts**:
		- **Pipeline**:
			- A pipeline is a collection of jobs that are executed in a specific order defined by stages.
		- **Job**:
			- A job is a single task (e.g., build, test, deploy) defined with a script that runs on a GitLab Runner.
		- **Stage**:
			- Stages group jobs that can run in parallel. Jobs in later stages run only after jobs in earlier stages have completed successfully.
		- **GitLab Runner**:
			- An agent that executes the pipeline jobs. Runners can be shared (provided by GitLab) or specific to your project.

	- **2. Creating a `.gitlab-ci.yml` File**:
		- The pipeline configuration is defined in a YAML file at the root of your repository named `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
		- **Basic Structure**:
		  ```yaml
		  stages:
		    - build
		    - test
		    - deploy
		  
		  variables:
		    APP_ENV: "production"
		  
		  build_job:
		    stage: build
		    script:
		      - echo "Building the project..."
		      - make build
		  
		  test_job:
		    stage: test
		    script:
		      - echo "Running tests..."
		      - make test
		  
		  deploy_job:
		    stage: deploy
		    script:
		      - echo "Deploying the project..."
		      - make deploy
		    only:
		      - main
		  ```
			- **`stages`**: Defines the order in which jobs will run.
			- **`variables`**: Sets global environment variables that are accessible to all jobs.
			- **`script`**: Lists the commands executed during a job.
			- **`only`**: Specifies that the job runs only on certain branches (e.g., `main`).

	- **3. Key Pipeline Features**:
		- **Artifacts**:
			- Artifacts are files generated by a job that can be passed on to subsequent jobs or downloaded after the pipeline run.
			- Example:
			  ```yaml
			  build_job:
			    stage: build
			    script:
			      - make build
			    artifacts:
			      paths:
			        - build/
			  ```
		- **Caching**:
			- Caches store dependencies or build files to speed up subsequent pipeline runs.
			- Example:
			  ```yaml
			  cache:
			    paths:
			      - node_modules/
			  ```
		- **Job Dependencies & Parallelism**:
			- Jobs within the same stage run in parallel.
			- Jobs in later stages will run only if the previous stages complete successfully.
		- **Conditional Execution**:
			- Use `only`, `except`, and rules to control when jobs should run based on branch, tags, or other conditions.
		- **Environment Variables and Secrets**:
			- Define variables in the GitLab UI or within the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to manage configurations and sensitive data securely.

	- **4. Advanced Pipeline Techniques**:
		- **Multi-Project Pipelines**:
			- Trigger pipelines in other repositories or coordinate complex workflows across projects.
		- **Dynamic Child Pipelines**:
			- Create child pipelines dynamically, splitting a large pipeline into smaller, manageable pieces.
		- **Manual Jobs & Approvals**:
			- Configure jobs that require manual intervention or approvals before continuing, useful for production deployments.
		- **Templates and Includes**:
			- Reuse common pipeline configurations using YAML includes or GitLab CI templates to maintain DRY principles.
			  
			  ---
	- **5. Best Practices**:
		- **Keep Pipelines Simple and Maintainable**:
			- Break complex pipelines into modular stages and jobs.
		- **Use Descriptive Job Names and Comments**:
			- Clear naming conventions help maintain clarity, especially in large pipelines.
		- **Leverage Caching and Artifacts**:
			- Improve build speeds and share necessary files between jobs.
		- **Secure Sensitive Data**:
			- Store secrets and tokens in GitLabâ€™s CI/CD variable settings rather than hardcoding them.
		- **Monitor Pipeline Performance**:
			- Analyze pipeline run times and failures to optimize and improve efficiency.
			  
			  ---
	- **Conclusion**:
		- GitLab CI/CD provides a powerful and flexible platform for automating your software lifecycle.
		- By defining your pipeline in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, you can automate building, testing, and deploying your application in a repeatable and consistent manner.
		- As your project grows, consider leveraging advanced features like multi-project pipelines, dynamic child pipelines, and manual approvals to manage complex workflows efficiently.
