# 1. Introduction
	- ## 1.1 Applications of Computer Networks
		- ### 1.1.1 Networks in Organizations
			- **Modern organizations**:
				- Heavily reliant on computers for tasks such as product development, payroll management, and document creation.
				- Initially isolated computers may later be networked for better information exchange.
			- **Purpose of networks**:
				- **Resource sharing**:
					- Access to hardware like network printers.
					- Centralized resources reduce costs (e.g., one printer for an office instead of individual printers).
				- **Information sharing**:
					- Electronic data critical for all organizations:
						- Customer reports.
						- Financial data.
						- Inventory records.
					- Example: A New York seller can access Singapore warehouse stock information instantly using a #VPN (Virtual Private Network).
				- **Communication and collaboration**:
					- Employees use email (#Email) and other tools for easy communication.
					- Advanced methods include #VoIP (Voice over IP), video conferencing, and shared desktop access for real-time collaboration.
			- **Client-server model**:
				- **Server**:
					- Centralized, powerful machine hosting applications and data.
					- Often maintained by system administrators in secure locations.
				- **Client**:
					- Less powerful computers accessing the server.
					- Can be laptops or desktops within the network.
		- ### 1.1.2 Networks for Personal Use
			- **Historical perspective**:
				- Early home computer use focused on word processing and games.
				- The internet now drives widespread adoption, enabling:
					- **Access to remote data**:
						- Browsing vast areas of knowledge.
						- Subscription services for personalized news.
					- **Social communication**:
						- #SocialNetworks like #Facebook enable sharing and connecting.
					- **E-commerce** (#ElectronicCommerce):
						- Online shopping (#B2C, #C2C) and supplier management (#B2B).
						- Emerging forms like #P2P networks for file sharing.
			- **Peer-to-peer networks**:
				- Examples: #BitTorrent.
				- Users exchange files without centralized servers.
				- Applications include legal content sharing and collaborative work.
		- ### 1.1.3 Wireless Networks
			- **Definition**:
				- Networks without physical connections, using radio waves or other wireless technologies.
			- **Applications**:
				- Portable devices (#Laptops, #Smartphones) use wireless connectivity to access the internet from anywhere.
				- **Technologies**:
					- #WiFi (#802.11 standard): Wireless LANs.
					- #CellularNetworks: Used for mobile internet (#3G, #4G, #5G).
					- #Bluetooth: Connects peripherals like headphones.
				- **Use cases**:
					- Real-time GPS navigation.
					- Business applications (e.g., logistics tracking).
		- ### 1.1.4 Social Implications
			- **Freedom of expression**:
				- Platforms like #SocialNetworks and discussion boards allow users to share views widely.
				- Challenges include offensive content and debates on censorship.
			- **Ethical and legal concerns**:
				- Piracy in #P2P networks.
				- Surveillance issues:
					- Government tools like #DCS1000 for email monitoring.
					- Privacy concerns with #RFID and tracking technologies.
			- **Spam and phishing**:
				- Spam: Unsolicited bulk emails.
				- Phishing: Fraudulent attempts to extract sensitive information.
	- ## 1.2 Network Hardware
		- ### 1.2.1 Personal Area Networks (PANs)
			- **Purpose**:
				- Connect devices near a single user.
				- Example: Wireless connections between a computer and its peripherals.
			- **Technology**:
				- #Bluetooth:
					- Master-slave configuration.
					- Used in devices like headphones, keyboards, and even medical equipment.
				- **Other technologies**:
					- #RFID for identification in smart cards and libraries.
		- ### 1.2.2 Local Area Networks (LANs)
			- **Definition**:
				- Private networks covering small areas like offices or homes.
			- **Types**:
				- **Wired LANs**:
					- Example: #Ethernet (#IEEE802.3).
					- Higher speeds (100 Mbps to 10 Gbps) and lower latency than wireless.
				- **Wireless LANs**:
					- Example: #WiFi (#IEEE802.11).
					- Popular in homes and places where cabling is impractical.
			- **Features**:
				- **Scalability**:
					- Networks can expand using switches and routers.
				- **Virtual LANs (VLANs)**:
					- Logical segmentation of a physical network.
					- Example: Separating departments like engineering and finance within the same building.
		- ### 1.2.3 Other Network Types
			- **Broadband Networks**:
				- **Definition**:
					- Networks that transmit data over a single channel shared by multiple devices.
				- **Broadcasting**:
					- Messages sent by one machine can be received by all others.
					- **Addressing**:
						- Machines check if the packet is addressed to them; if not, they ignore it.
					- **Special cases**:
						- Broadcast messages addressed to all machines simultaneously.
						- **Multicasting**:
							- Messages sent to a subset of machines within the network.
			- **Point-to-Point Networks**:
				- **Definition**:
					- Direct communication between two devices.
				- **Features**:
					- Data must often travel through multiple intermediate nodes.
					- Important to determine the most efficient route.
				- **Unicasting**:
					- A message sent from one sender to one receiver.
